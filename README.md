Our client DriverPass wanted a system to help others pass their driving tests on the first try. They were looking for a system which enabled users to easily schedule training, study for their tests, and ace them. Personally, I believe I listened to and met the user requirements particularly well, as every aspect the user requested has been planned out in the program. In regards to the charting however, they could use some work, as it's important to display to the client in a digestible manner exactly what they're getting. Interpreting their needs was done in an organized manner, starting with them communicating clearly to me what they want out of the program, I then documented and began to translate their needs into executable functions. It's important to consider the user's needs as this is what they are coming to you for, to bring their necessities into a functional program. If you don't deliver on that, you're not doing your job correctly. As far as designing software goes, I like to begin from a very general standpoint, and then build from that big abstract idea. I pick apart the list of needs and build functions one by one and then piece the whole thing together, making adjustments along the way.
